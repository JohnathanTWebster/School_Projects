Design, code, and test a C++ application that can be used for transactions at a hotdog cart. The application has two inputs: the amount due and the amount received from the customer. Display the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that the customer should receive as change. You should give the customer the fewest number of bills/coins possible. Hint: Integer Division and Remainder (both covered in ch 2) will be helpful for this program. Your application should contain NO magic numbers. Make sure you prompt the user for the two inputs. Make sure your output is formatted properly and includes text that tells the user what the output represents.

Test your application with plenty of values to ensure that it's working properly, then submit output with the following values:

An amount due of $17.32 and amount received of $20.00.

An amount due of $6.11 and amount received of $10.00.
